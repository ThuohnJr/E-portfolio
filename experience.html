            <p>I began my engineering journey in my second year of school
                during the internal workshop practice. This is where I first got a hands on feel with engineering.
                We visited some companies like Kenya Pipeline Company, Safaricom, Chemelil Sugar Company and Rivatex among others.
                During these trips we interacted with industry professionals and got to see how the relation of things we learrn in class apply in
                I got to learn a lot of skills during this time.</p>
                <p>In my 4th year of school, I was attached at Kenya Power,Nairobi South, Donholm station. Here I got to work on power distribution systems.
                I got to gain some experience with power engineering. I was first scheduled with the Design and Construction department which was responsible for design and construction of power lines in different sections of Nairobi South.
                I was particularly impressed by my team leader, a bulky man who commanded his team like a 5 star general. He would notify us of the job we were to do while enroute to the site detailing everyones roles and splitting us into teams.
                This was very effective in terms of organization and morale of the work itself as often we would complete a single task in less than two hours then proceed to the next site. We once laid six spans of cable in less than an hour in  a job site near Athi River.
                Despite being an attachee, I was very proud of our work that day.</p>
                <p>In my 5th year of school, I went back to Kenya Power for my second attachment. This time I mostly worked with the Operation and Maintenance department.
                I got to see how maintenance of power lines is done, routinely taking observations of power lines to see their physical conditions, a skill that I have held onto even to this day.
                I really enjoyed my time with Kenya Power.
